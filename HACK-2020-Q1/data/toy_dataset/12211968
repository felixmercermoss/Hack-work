The rise in VAT and petrol set our expenses beyond my budget each month. My family is thrifty. We felt squeezed and dare not even go for any holidays. We have a two-year-old son. To cut costs, we decided to turn off heating even though it is winter and instead wear many layers of clothes. My son will wear several layers. At night, if it is too cold, we bring our son to sleep with us so that he will be warm and we don't have to turn on the heating for him. As a result, I do not get a good night sleep. Whenever possible, I use the Freecycle website. I also realised in recent months, people are asking for things rather than giving away items. <bold>Christina Spybey, London</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"People should take control of petrol prices by boycotting petrol companies one at a time. Rather than stop the flow of petrol and create hardship for people who need to travel. Let the company do without the cash flow and let them do the work of bringing pressure on the government to reduce the duty on fuel. Maybe a month without the cash flow from hard working British people will make the right people sit up and take notice. Everyone is fed up of rip off Britain lets do something about it collectively. <bold>Edward Martin Luther, Bedwellty Blackwood, Gwent, Wales</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Inflation - despite what the official figures say is definitely on the rise - quite quickly. Trust me - when you earn £10,000 a year you're the first to notice, when you earn £30,000 it will be far, far later before you spot it! <bold>Jim</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Basically if you have a place to stay in the UK i.e. property you are &quot;sorted&quot;. There is still only one main financial problem in the UK and it's the price of a house. In the UK you can save up for almost anything you want and buy and it, the problem only arises when you need to find a place to put it. When it comes to a house you have to pay tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of pounds for a square of dirt that has been there for five billion years. So, no I am not worried too much about prices, except the price of property. It's a complete rip off in the UK. Forget tuition fees. It's rent that is the number one problem for students. At least the university does something in return for the money given to it. My advice for young people is to go to a local university to stop the fat cats getting your rent money and do not buy a house until the prices have fallen into the abyss. <bold>John Michael, Cupar, Fife, Scotland</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"The inflation increase is ridiculously high in 2011. I can understand that the government is trying to save the public sector by saving money so we can get out of the economic crisis. However I feel the costs of living, such as oil and gas prices, have gone through the roof and these prices need negotiating. <bold>Henry Wade, Cambridgeshire</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Rising energy costs, higher food prices and increasing cost of basic commodities are all beyond our control. How on earth does raising interest rates help anyone? I personally am getting less for more money. <bold>Paul Matthews, Colchester</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"This inflation index is completely meaningless. The cost of everyday items such as food, gas and electricity and insurance are equated against items such as white goods, audio equipment and household items that are purchased perhaps once every five years or more. It would be more honest to produce an index related to the median of consumers and the older generation to indicate accurately the true burden that is being imposed upon this group. This would perhaps show the very clever leaders of our country that we are not all on expense accounts and are forced to pay the results of their rulings, however unfair they may be.<bold> John Humphrey, Lancing</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"How can the Bank of England's monetary unit justify upping the interest rate. The general public have paid through the nose because of the banks' failures. Now they are going to suffer due to the restrictions in place on the public purse. They have had a VAT increase, are paying almost 25% more for fuel this year than last and now they want us to pay more for our mortgages. It's the banks and financial institutions who are profiteering from speculators on the oil, food and money markets. They should be hit first and not the general public. <bold>Jason Piers, London</bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"These are commodities consumers can't do without - oil, petrol and the like. People should not be penalised for filling up their vehicles. I'm now driving a 1.2 litre engine car from 2.0 litre engine car. Where is it going to stop? We need to get to work to make a living. There needs to be another way of curbing inflation. You can't control prices in an economy in which you can't control the number of people. The more people there are in a country, the higher demand for items. It's supply and demand. Control the flow of people, then the demand for goods will come down. <bold>Alan Augustin, Woking </bold>","markupType":"candy_xml","type":"paragraph"},{"text":"Our household budget has been significantly cut back as a result of the recession. The threat of rising inflation and interest rates is going to be very difficult to cope with. I work in the construction industry as an architect and have had to survive with a 15% pay cut since May 2009. Whilst we have benefited from the low interest rates on our mortgage we have already had to cut back. The rising cost of living and the potential mortgage increase will have a big impact on my wife and three children.
